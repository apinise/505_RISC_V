WARNING: [Synth 8-6841] Block RAM (genblk1[1].data_mem_reg) originally specified as a Byte Wide Write Enable RAM cannot take advantage of ByteWide feature and is implemented with single write enable per RAM due to following reason.
(address width (14) is more than optimal threshold of 12. Implementing using BWWE will require more logic and timing would be suboptimal. Please use attribute ram_decomp = power if BWWE is desired.)

WARNING: [Synth 8-6841] Block RAM (data_mem/genblk1[1].data_mem_reg) originally specified as a Byte Wide Write Enable RAM cannot take advantage of ByteWide feature and is implemented with single write enable per RAM due to following reason.
(address width (14) is more than optimal threshold of 12. Implementing using BWWE will require more logic and timing would be suboptimal. Please use attribute ram_decomp = power if BWWE is desired.)
